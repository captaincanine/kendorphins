						<p>For 12 years, I followed a successful path in baseball moving from achievement to achievement. I was a talented and hard working athlete, and my journey took me from Little League all the way up to professional baseball in the MiLB. There always seemed to be a logical next step for me within baseball, but after a long period of dissatisfaction and a feeling of disconnection from myself, I realized that I wanted to pursue something else, and I decided to step away from baseball in 2011. 2011 was a chaotic year&hellip; It started with some high highs and ended with some low lows: I graduated from Elon University, I played in my first season of professional baseball, I came out as gay, I played in my last season of professional baseball, I was disowned, I experienced a painful breakup, and found myself homeless. I essentially went from feeling like I had the world in my hands, to feeling like I had no direction, no purpose, and most notably, no value.</p>
						<p>During my week-long stint of homelessness, I remember staring out onto the train tracks at the Christopher Street 1 Train Station in New York City, and feeling as if my life was over. I noticed a large New York City rat, the largest I had ever seen, running up the train track with a large piece of food in its mouth. I had an epiphany. I thought: “If this creature of lesser intelligence than I can not only survive, but thrive, under these same conditions that I am in, then what the hell am I doing sitting here feeling sorry for myself?” That rat was the spark that I needed to light the fire that has turned into my burning resolve now. I reached out to a friend for help, and although it was a long-shot, I received it.</p> 
						<p>I discovered my own personal voice and message teaching in the group fitness industry at Barry’s Bootcamp, Flywheel Sports, and PROJECT by Equinox, while simultaneously starting my own private training business combining fitness, mindset, and spirituality. My private training business evolved into my Success Coaching business, where I combine my BA in Psychology, my experience as a Division 1 College and professional athlete, my training credentials through the National Academy of Sports Medicine, over a decade of spiritual and psychological research, my credentials as a graduate of iPEC coaching school, and my experience as an entrepreneur in New York City.</p>

						<h3>What is a success coach?</h3>
						<p>Success Coaching is a powerful fusion of business coaching, life coaching, and health coaching. A Success Coach is a powerful and motivational outcome-based coach that works with their client to increase the quality of their life, and their prosperity within their pursuits. A Success Coaching relationship is built through dialogue, inquiry, action-plans, and accountability, and is based in trust and confidentiality. Kenneth strives to work with his clients to significantly increase the quality of their lives.</p>
